# Congress Birth Year Time Series Analysis (Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the distribution of U.S. Congress members by birth year using Tableau. 

The goal was to build a proper time-series visualization with an interactive date filter to analyze historical birth-year trends.

---

## 📊 Visualization Built

- Time Series Line Chart
- X-axis: Year of Birthday (Continuous Date)
- Y-axis: Count of Members (COUNT of Bioguide ID)
- Interactive Date Range Filter

---

## 🧠 Key Insight

The visualization shows:

- Very low representation for early birth years (1860–1875)
- Gradual increase in members born between 1880–1945
- Peak concentration around 1930–1945
- Gradual decline after 1950

The decline in later years is likely influenced by:
- Age eligibility requirements
- Dataset coverage limitations
- Natural generational representation
